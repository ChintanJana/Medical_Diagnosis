        "### Purpose:\n",
        "The code aims to create an expert system for medical disease diagnosis by using a Prolog knowledge base and a Python script for user interaction and disease probability calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Import Libraries:**\n",
        "   - The code uses the `Prolog` library from the `pyswip` package to interact with the Prolog knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Load Knowledge Base:**\n",
        "   - The Prolog knowledge base file is loaded using the `prolog.consult(\"diseases.pl\")` command.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Collect Symptoms:**\n",
        "   - The `collect_symptoms` function allows users to interactively input their symptoms by asking a series of questions about each symptom. The responses are stored in a list called `symptoms`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Calculate Disease Probability:**\n",
        "   - The `calculate_disease_probability` function calculates the probability of a single disease based on the provided symptoms.\n",
        "   - It retrieves the required symptoms for the disease from the knowledge base and compares them to the user's symptoms to calculate the probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Find Disease Probabilities:**\n",
        "   - The `find_disease_probabilities` function iterates through all diseases in the knowledge base, calculates their probabilities, and stores the results in a list of tuples `(disease_name, probability)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Main Program:**\n",
        "   - The main program begins by collecting symptoms using the `collect_symptoms` function.\n",
        "   - It then calculates the disease probabilities based on the collected symptoms using the `find_disease_probabilities` function.\n",
        "   - The probabilities are sorted in descending order.\n",
        "   - If a disease is diagnosed with a probability of 100%, it is printed as the result. If not, it prints the most probable disease with its probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage:\n",
        "1. Run the script.\n",
        "2. Answer the questions with \"yes\" or \"no\" to provide your symptoms.\n",
        "3. The program will diagnose possible diseases based on your symptoms."
